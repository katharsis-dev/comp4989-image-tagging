Why CNNs at all? Why not RNNs? 

What Chi En cares about is the WHY of the architecture of our CNN (versus the how)

Why does it need to go through 3 layers of pooling?

Why is CNN able to detect features from images?

What are the implications of additional layers?

What is model-free, what is model-based

Don’t walk through code! You can show it, but don’t do a full-on review

**make sure to cite any code we use that isn’t ours
